# StoryShare: Online Publishing Platform

StoryShare is an online publishing platform that was inspired from Medium.com.

## Motivations

The main motivation for this project was to build out a REST API for a blogging platform using Node.js. I decided to build out the backend separately than the frontend client. 

Here were most of the things I had to implement for this API:

* Implementing authentication routes
* Building out all the models and model-relationships
* Enabling commenting functionality
* CRUD endpoints for Articles
* Adding 'Following' feature to app
* Implementing routes for Article feed (public and logged in feeds are different)

## Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB (Mongoose used for building our models)
* Passport.js
* JWT

## Models

* User
* Article
* Comment

## Final Thoughts

Main objective was to understand how to build a REST API with Node/Express, and understand everything that goes into building the backend of a web application. This was a side project as well. :)
